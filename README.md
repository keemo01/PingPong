# Ping Pong Game

Hey there! This is a simple guide to help you understand the Ping Pong game. It's a fun game where you hit a ball back and forth using paddles. We made it with JavaScript for the game rules, HTML for the structure, and CSS for the looks.

## What's in the Code

## HTML Structure
The game's web page has a canvas for drawing the game, some buttons for picking the game's difficulty, and a spot to show a message when the game ends.

## JavaScript
JavaScript controls how the game works. It makes the ball move, checks if it hits the paddles or walls, keeps score, and lets you choose the game's difficulty.

## CSS
CSS makes the game look cool. It styles the canvas, messages, buttons, and makes sure the game works well on different screens.

## How to Play

## Here's how you can play the game:

When the page loads, the game begins right away.
Move your mouse left and right to control your paddle (the one at the bottom). It will follow your mouse.
The aim is to keep hitting the ball back and forth. You get points when the ball passes your opponent's paddle (the one at the top) and goes out at the top.
If the ball goes past your paddle and out at the bottom, your opponent gets points.
The game keeps going until one side reaches a set number of points.
When the game finishes, you can click "Play Again" to restart or "Select Difficulty" to pick a different level of challenge.

## Difficulty Levels

You can make the game easier or harder by choosing a difficulty level when you start:

Easy: Slower ball and slower opponent paddle.
Medium: A bit faster ball and opponent paddle.
Hard: Fast ball and a quick opponent paddle.

## Responsive Game

Don't worry about your device size; the game works well on big screens and small ones too.
