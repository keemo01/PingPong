# Ping Pong Game

This readme provides an overview of the JavaScript-based Ping Pong game code and its associated HTML and CSS.

## Introduction

Ping Pong is a classic arcade game where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The game has been implemented using JavaScript for logic, HTML for the structure, and CSS for styling.

## HTML Structure
The game's HTML structure includes a canvas for rendering the game, buttons for difficulty selection in a modal, and a container for displaying the game over message.

## JavaScript
The JavaScript code controls the game's logic, including ball movement, paddle interaction, scoring, and difficulty levels.

## CSS
The CSS code provides styling for the game, including the canvas, game over message, buttons, and responsiveness for different screen sizes.

## How to Play

When the page loads, the game starts automatically.
Control the player's paddle (bottom) by moving your mouse horizontally. The paddle follows your mouse movement.
The goal is to hit the ball back and forth, preventing it from passing your paddle while trying to get it past the computer's paddle (top).
If the ball passes your paddle and goes out of bounds at the bottom, the computer scores a point. Conversely, if the ball passes the computer's paddle and goes out at the top, you score a point.
The game continues until either you or the computer reaches the winning score.
When the game is over, you can click "Play Again" to restart or "Select Difficulty" to choose a different difficulty level.

## Difficulty Levels

You can choose from three difficulty levels when starting the game:

Easy: Slower ball speed and slower computer paddle movement.
Medium: Moderate ball speed and computer paddle movement.
Hard: Faster ball speed and faster computer paddle movement.

## Responsiveness

The game is designed to be responsive and playable on both large screens and mobile devices.

## Enjoy the Game!

Have fun playing Ping Pong and enjoy challenging yourself with different difficulty levels!
